Acid-violet waves have kissed our eyelids
we have ran from rotten planet like a bastards,like a bastards
there is no place for us, among wasted in the hole
among those who wanted truth,choking of their own lies
we dont care, we're not human
laughing and dont give a fuck
we dont care,we're not children
we will kill,its our luck
we've knocked on you comfy windows
we've jerked on your sainly priests
we were spat and spat your bibles
we've cum in your open wounds
we have dressed your civil clothes
dressed your grey and stupid faces
you wear us on your poor necks,and you have to pray on us!
under banners of elite
to eternity we've led
under banners of elite
to the precipice we've led
we dont care,we're not human
laughing and dont give a fuck
we dont care,we're not children
we will kill,its our luck
we were fetuses in your whores
we were dying in your dirty touches
we have poisoned your fuckin faith
we have raped your friggin fables
we have rushed your crappy thoughts
we have got your rotten veins
we have broken your shitty lives
put through it our toxic genes
One and two, three, four and five
On the Cross we'll sutisfied
six and seven, eight, nine, ten
You want to hang us. Fuck you then.
